## Background
- We are in the economic recenssion now based on many factors such as inflation and war over the world.
- More than **88,000 workers** in the U.S. tech sector have been **laid off** in mass job cuts in 2022, according to a [Crunchbase News tally](https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs-2022/).
- Therefore, I would like to think of **how to enhance the economic situations** based on more **job opportunities creation**.
- As one of ways to expand the business area, I would like to suggest the different approach of **Metaverse economy** as the **next generation ubiquitous business**.

## Different Approach from U-Biz to Meta-Biz

- Some people think that Metaverse may fail as virtual reality is separated area with the current internet business.
- However, we could differently think such that we already live in Metaverse. Because the real world is part of Metaverse which calls Mixed Reality.
- Hence, I would like to share a new idea of formula where `Meta-Biz = V-Biz + U-Biz + E-Biz + Offline-Biz` as the following picture and table.

Biz Area        | Description         | Different Thinking                 
----------------|---------------------|------------------------------------
**Offline-Biz** | Retail store        |                               
**E-Biz**       | Internet Business   | `E-Biz    = Internet-Biz + Offline-Biz`
**U-Biz**       | Ubiquitous Business | `U-Biz    = U-Biz + E-Biz + Offline-Biz`
**Meta-Biz**    | Meta Business       | `Meta-Biz = V-Biz + U-Biz + E-Biz + Offline-Biz`

## Brainstorming

- As of now in 2022, Facebook especially changed the name of company as Meta, and lots of companies have been working on Metaverse business.
- Some companies do not use the keyworkd of Metaverse, but they are working on some part of area like AR, VR, and even the current business which is also part of Metaverse.
- I would say some companies business do not involve the virtual world are also working on Metaverse. It means that everything is already in Metaverse such as ubiquitous.
- Brainstorming is a simple, natural strategy for ideation and problem solving. It motivates people to dream up new ideas that may seem a little insane without negative feedback each other at first.
- Let's start brainstorming of how to expand the business area based on next internet/ubiquitous business (a.k.a. Meta-Biz or other key word if you want).

## Conclusion
- This article is a type of campain to influence people with positive approach to resolve the economic recession.
- Different approach to expand business area: `Meta-Biz = V-Biz + U-Biz + E-Biz + Offline-Biz`.
- We can make other key word if anyone has better naming instead of `Meta-Biz`.
- Everything(business area, job opportunities, laid-off, life, happiness, health, collaboration, war, crime, environment, B2B, B2C, G2C, G2B, etc.) is connected each other such as chain.
- Let's try to ideate more business/tech/job opportunities based on positive approach and collaboration in the next generation ubiquitous business.
